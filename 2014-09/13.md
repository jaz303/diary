Does this still work? OK it still works. Yay for no bit-rot.

### CommandBox

Packaged it up and published it.

### jester

Starting redoing the jester parser __again__, now that I know how to use pegjs properly. The hand-coded parser is a complete mess. After the parser is fixed I'll hook it back into the import resolution engine I wrote a while back and then make a proper start on implementing the compiler. Going to drop the bytecode though, for now, and just do it all with environment objects. Life's too short.

Result - top level parsing complete. Still got expression generation, AST instantiation and the pre-lexer phase (to handle the compose operator and certain no-paren calls) to take care of.

### stash

Goal - first pass at data model

### kidsh

Goal - port over to new component architecture

### live CES thing

Goal - UI skeleton and a naive CommandBox powered interface for putting shapes on the stage

### Lisp in Small Pieces

Goal - 10 pages
