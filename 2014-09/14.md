### kidsh

Refactored to use new component system everywhere.

So far the new component system feels pretty good; I can see how it could possibly be improved with a more concise syntax layer on top to remove some of the verbosity. Not going to try that in this app, though.

### stash

Wrote a workbook loader and in the process ended up yak-shaving an asynchronous functional collection manipulator. Might be worth extracting but I have this feeling I've only scratched the surface of what's possible - need to further investigate monads etc... I'd like if it was possible to handle collections/individual items using the same code.
