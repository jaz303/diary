### FPGA

Plan: some small modules, building up to 8 bit ALU

Underestimated this one. Have implemented a variety of muxes and learned to use ActiveHDL simulator to detect and fix glitches in combinatorial designs. Must revisit chapter on Karnaugh maps.

### Inverted canvas text

Made a quick sketch demonstrating overlapping canvases and use of `destination-out` composite operation make textured/animated text.

### curiosity

Plan: test type system, implement auto-conversion, project layout, workspace switcher

### friendpipe

Plan: implement email protocol

Done. Final task: read files into the main script and send away.

### demo-a-week

Plan: publish A-star
