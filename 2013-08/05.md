### curiosity

Flung together a type basic type system. Still to do implicit/automatic conversions. This stuff will need to tested, too important to wing it.

Still to do this week

  * finish/test type system API
  * type system implicit conversions
  * inlets and outlets / signals and slots
  * task system
  * task meta
  * commit to a project structure and set up bower to do all the annoying shit
  * skeleton workspace switcher

Feeling confident!
