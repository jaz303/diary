### curiosity

More work on the big code re-org. Removed `browserify` because its `require()` conflicts with the native node(-webkit) version. Will need to find a way to make the two co-exist in the future so we can publish a web-based version.

Still to do (hopefully today):

  * finish porting `Workspace`
  * create base class for views (with auto unbinding etc)
  * signals
  * finish type system and test
  * multiple workspace creation + hotkeys

Need to have a brainstorm on how to do signals/events, will take some notes later.

### FPGA

Practiced 2,3,4-variable Karnaugh maps. Will get some more practice later with a 7-segment LED decoder.

### Plan

  * Racket http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket/
  * Clojure 7L7W
  * 7-seg
  * Curiosity
  * Lemur - JS API
  * Readin

### Clojure

  * make string: (str 1) (str \a \b \c)
  * sequence operations: first, last, rest, cons, concat
  * (println "foo")
  * [:this :is :a :vector]
  * (nth [:a :b :c] 1) =&gt; :b
  * set: #{:a :b :c}
  * operations: count, sort
  * (clojure.set/union), (clojure.set/difference)
  * sets are functions: (#{:a :b :c} :b) =&gt; :b (membership test)
  * map: {:k1 "v1" :k2 "v2"}
  * (def my-map {:a "b" :c "d"}), (my-map :a)
  * merge maps: (merge {:a "b"} {:c "d"})
  * sorted-set, sorted-map
  * struct - (defstruct movie :title :year :genre)
  * (struct movie "Fast and Furious 6" 2013 "Nonsense")
  * (my-movie :title) =&gt; access the title
  * (defn add "optional docstring" [a b] (+ a b))
  * (doc add) =&gt; access documentation
  * Anonymous functions: `(fn [a b] (+ a b))`
  * Shorter form: `#(* 2 (count %))`
  * `(apply + '(1 2 3))` =&gt; `6`
  * `(filter odd? '(1 2 3))`

#### Destructuring

    (defn line-end [[_ second]] second)

    (def board [[:x :o :x] [:o :x :o] [:x :o :x]])
    (def center [[_ [_ c _] _]] c)

    (let [[_ a _] [1 2 3]] a)
    
    (let [{name :name} {:name "jason"}] name)
