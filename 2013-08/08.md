### curiosity

More work on the big code re-org. Removed `browserify` because its `require()` conflicts with the native node(-webkit) version. Will need to find a way to make the two co-exist in the future so we can publish a web-based version.

Still to do (hopefully today):

  * finish porting `Workspace`
  * create base class for views (with auto unbinding etc)
  * signals
  * finish type system and test
  * multiple workspace creation + hotkeys

Need to have a brainstorm on how to do signals/events, will take some notes later.

### FPGA

Practiced 2,3,4-variable Karnaugh maps. Will get some more practice later with a 7-segment LED decoder.
