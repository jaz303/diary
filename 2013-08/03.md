Spent ages fucking about reorganising `curiosity` to work with node-webkit. In the end if was pretty much negative progress, the whole thing is broken now and. Extracted the `nw-context` module for sharing document/window objects between contexts then immediately realised this was pointless because I could just assign them to the global object. Oh well. Released the module anyway because some people don't like globals.
