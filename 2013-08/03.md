Spent ages fucking about reorganising `curiosity` to work with node-webkit. In the end if was pretty much negative progress, the whole thing is broken now. Extracted the `nw-context` module for sharing document/window objects between contexts then immediately realised this was pointless because I could just assign them to the global object. Oh well. Released the module anyway because some people don't like globals. Going to change tacks here and work on the task/type/IPC mechanism for a while because I'm burned out on the UI stuff.

Wrote a script for managing this diary, a dodgy bit of shell, but it's working so far.
