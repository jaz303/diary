### curiosity

Type system 90% written and tested - just to implement a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm for automatic type conversion and that's it done. Will come back to it later today.

### Clojure

Doing day 2 of the Clojure chapter of "7 Languages in 7 Weeks".

#### `loop`

This loops forever:

    (loop [x 0 y 0] (recur (inc x) (inc y)))

#### Predicates

  * `every?`
  * `some`
  * `not-every?`
  * `not-any?`

#### Modifying sequences

  * `(filter fn seq)`
  * `(map fn seq)`
  * `(for [x seq1, y seq2...] (...))` - list comprehension
  * `(for [x seq, :when (foo? x)] (...))` - + filter/guard
  * `(reduce + [1 2 3 4])`
  * `(sort [4 3 2 1])`
  * `(sort-by foo [1 2 3 4])`

#### Lazy Evaluation

  * `(range 1 10)`
  * `(range 1 10 3)`
  * `(range 10)`
  * `(take 3 (repeat "foobar"))`
  * `(take 5 (cycle [:work :buy :consume :die]))`
  * `(take 5 (drop 2 (cycle [...])))`
  * `(take 5 (interpose :and (repeat :foo)))`
  * `(take 20 (interleave (cycle (range 2)) (cycle (range 3))))`
  * `(take 4 (iterate inc 1))` - takes fn and starting value

    (defn fib-pair [[a b]] [b (+ a b)])
    (map first (iterate fib-pair [1 1]))

#### Protocols and types
