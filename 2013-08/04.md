### FPGA

Read up on `always` blocks, makes all sense now. Was interested to learn about the constraints that apply to their use, and the corollary that not all Verilog designs are synthesizable.

Takeaways:

  * `always @(posedge clk)` - sequential
  * `always @(*)` - combinatorial, runs constantly
  * can only write to each `reg` variable from a single `always` block

In reflection, I need to become more familiar with the available range of 7400 logic ICs. When I was trying to derive the PWM circuit I was thinking in terms of counters, registers, and basic logic gates - because that's all I really knew about. If a comparator had been part of my design vocabulary I think I would have been able to find the solution myself. Aside: look at the implementation of various PSoC digital blocks.

### Curiosity

Plan: start a new codebase and write it _properly_&trade;. GUI layout + workspace switcher. Also: __must__ do some work on task system.

### friendpipe

Plan: write configuration routines.

Done. Wrote a script entry point too.

### Demo-a-week

Last week I decided to start making one small game/graphics/AI-related demo a week and publish it on my blog. Predictably, like anything I'm involved with, this turned into a giant fucking yak shave but I've mostly followed through with it, albeit one week behind schedule. I will publish the A-star demo tonight.

### ClojureScript

Plan: set up a development environment.
