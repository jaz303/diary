### curiosity

Did some work on task system, inlets, outlets, kernel. Nothing concrete. Made a simple "turtle" system as an eventual test case for inter-task communication.

### Reading

#### PEfI

Read ~30 pages of chapter 12 (Digital Electronics). Going to have a go at making the following circuits in Logisim:

  * 2-1, 4-1 multiplexer
  * 1-4 demultiplexer
  * 3-8 decoder

Made these.

__Bubble pushing:__ application of De Morgan's theorem in logic circuit diagrams, used to form equivalent logic circuits. Replace AND gate with OR (or vice versa), and toggle presence of inversion bubbles on all ins/outs.

__AND-OR-INVERTER gates:__ these ICs contain a bunch of AND gates feeding into a single NOR gate, and can be used to implement logic functions expressed as sum-of-products.

Knocked together a reference card containing the boolean alegbra identities. Will add more as I need it.

#### LPI

Read chapters 51 &amp; 52. Wrote up notes in the usual place.
